# Discord.JS help bot!

A simple bot to help people maintain their programming help related servers. Capable of fetching [discord.js documentation](https://discord.js.org/#/docs/main/stable/general/welcome) & make and configure user snippets! More features coming out soon :)

## Installation

Clone this repository and create a `config.json` in cloned folder.
It should look something like this - 
```json
{
    "token": "Your bot's token",
    "mongo": "Your mongodb cluster url"
}
```

## Usage

Once you have your bot's folder ready, open a terminal in the directory and make sure you have the latest version of [node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm).
Once you have both, run `npm install` in your terminal to install all the dependecies.
Then to start the bot, run `node index.js` in your terminal and check if your bot is online. Once it's online, use can use all its commands!!
